Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

Every day is a new beginning. Take a deep breath, smile, and start again.

Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

The best way to predict the future is to create it.

Stay positive, work hard, and make it happen.
